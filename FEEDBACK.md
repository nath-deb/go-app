Did you like the test?

Yes, I liked the test, it was a complex and tricky task. 

Set Up and Configuration: 

I used "minikube" for my Kubernetes cluster, I struggled mostly with App building and setting up the database because I have limited knowledge on Go and Postgres, but this task helps me to grow my knowledge.

I have taken total 18hrs to complete the task, also I am able to connect the app which shows “Well done :)”. I have integrated Prometheus and Grafana with my Kubernetes cluster. 

I have placed the Docker Image in my DockerHub public repository,

You can find the Image in below URL,
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nathdeb006/goapp


All the conditions are fulfilled like, Service running with HPA, StatefulSet pod with persistency, basic monitoring for the StatefulSet pod

All the YAML files are in the folder "specs" and "monitoring"

HOPE THINGS WILL MOVE IN POSITIVE DIRECTION !!!!
